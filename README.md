## Hi , I'm MelðŸ‘‹

I'm a mostly self-taught **software engineer** with eight years of experience in the tech industry. I love learning new technologies and pairing with others on fun, challenging problems.
ðŸ’¡ I'm currently doing a batch at the [**Recurse Center**](https://www.recurse.com/), where I'm working on a project that combines my joy of **programming** and **learning Chinese**.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as written Simplified and Traditional Chinese characters.
